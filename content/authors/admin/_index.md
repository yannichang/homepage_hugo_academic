My research focuses on the development of numerical solvers in C++ to solve multiphase problems.  
In addition, I have a keen interest in the software development, such as Cloud Computing, Database Development, and Big Data.
I completed my Ph.D. in the University of Texas at Arlignton, where I was advised by Dr. Albert Tong.
